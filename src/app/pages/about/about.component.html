  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Why? Ever since I can remember, it has been my dream to create an Angular 4 web app with that helps the clickbait fishing masses improve the strength of their passwords with utterly ridiculous suggestions.</p>

  <p>Who? Iâ€™m Matt. You may remember me from such websites as Medium and www.matthewquerzoli.com.</p>
