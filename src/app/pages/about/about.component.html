        <h6>What?</h6>
        <p>This website will make you passwords harder to crack than, well, password123.</p>
        <h6>Why?</h6>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, it has been my dream to create an Angular 4 web app with that helps the clickbait fishing masses improve the strength of their passwords with utterly ridiculous suggestions.</p>
        <h6>No, really, why?</h6>
        <p>In my experience, lots of people have crappy passwords. I thought I'd make something to bring awareness to it. With a bit of humour.</p>
        <h6>Who?</h6>
