        <h6>What?</h6>
        <p>This website will make your passwords harder to crack than, well, <i>password123</i>.</p>
        <h6>Why?</h6>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, it has been my dream to create an Angular web app with that helps the clickbait-obsessed masses improve the strength of their passwords with utterly ridiculous suggestions.</p>
        <h6>No, really, why?</h6>
        <p>In my experience, lots of people have crappy passwords. I thought I'd make something to bring awareness to it. With a bit of humour. And don't worry, I can't see any passwords you enter.</p>
        <h6>Who the bloody hell are you?</h6>
        <p>Iâ€™m Matt.

        <h6>Go away.</h6>
        <p>No.</p>
