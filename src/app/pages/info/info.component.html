        <p>Computers are pretty damn good for a lot of things, but they can also be a bit of a liability.</p>
        <p>One of the best ways you can protect your data online is make sure your password is hard to crack.</p>
        <p>The longer and more complex it is, the longer it takes to crack.</p>
        <p>And despite some of the suggestions on here, it's best not to use words themselves, because they can be easily loaded from a dictionary by whatever brute-force program is being used. <b>Best practice is to use a sentence (for ease of rememberence), but only type in the first two letters of each word.</b></p>
